# Introduction

> `KavaRef` is a modern Java reflection API implemented using Kotlin.

## Background

This is a modern Java reflection API implemented using Kotlin, designed to provide a cleaner and easier-to-use API while retaining the power of Java
reflection.

The project icon is designed by [MaiTungTM](https://github.com/Lagrio) and is named from **K**otlinJ**avaRef**lection, meaning Java reflection
implemented using Kotlin.

It was first born in the [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiHookAPI), and was later decoupled into
the [YukiReflection](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiReflection) project.

As you can see, KavaRef is an entirely new API set refactored around the design principles of YukiReflection. It carries no affiliation and has officially replaced YukiReflection as the new reflection solution.

If you are using YukiReflection or the YukiHookAPI project related to it, you can refer to [here](../config/migration) to migrate the reflection API to KavaRef.

## Usage

KavaRef is built with Kotlin **lambda** syntax in a Java Builder style.

It can replace [Java's native Reflection API](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html) and implement a more complete reflection solution with a more human-friendly language.

## Skill Requirements

You should be proficient with Java's native reflection APIs, understand Java's class loading mechanisms, bytecode structures, and how they are used in Kotlin (if you are using Kotlin).

## Language Requirement

It is recommended to use Kotlin. API composition also supports Java,
but in pure Java projects, KavaRef may not be able to demonstrate its full functionality and syntactic sugar advantages.

All the demo sample code in the documentation will be described using Kotlin first.
If you don't know how to use Kotlin at all, you may not be able to fully experience and use the functionality of KavaRef.
